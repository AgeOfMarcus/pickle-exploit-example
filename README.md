# pickle vulnerability exploit
pickle is a python serialization library, which allows efficient binary serialization and loading of python datatypes. 

In the documentation, the developer(s) state:<br>
```
Warning: The pickle module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.
```

# target: `vulnerable-server.py`
http server running on localhost:3333<br>
methods:<br>
1. `GET /new` - generates a uuid, pickles it, base64 encodes it, and returns it to the user (also saved in memory with time value)
2. `POST /check` - accepts form 'key' (result from `GET /new`), base64 decodes it, depickles it (***vulnerable***). If key is in memory, returns the timestamp. If not, returns "none"
